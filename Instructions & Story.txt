To The Moon

Story:
 
	In the future, there is too much space debris in our atmosphere that it prevents space travel. 
	NASA has to send a robot up to the moon to clear the debris. 
	It will use a gizmo in its legs/feet to hop from cloud to cloud into the sky.

Instructions:

	1. Use WASD to navigate through the scene.
	2. Use the spacebar to jump into the sky.
	3. White clouds are safe to land on
	4. Storm clouds are dangerous, landing on them will mean taking damage.
	5. After a certain height, there will be some clouds that you can fall through.
	6. To return the menu, hit Escape or run out of health.
	7. Try to get as high in the sky as possible!
